            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>"This project was assigned by our professor as part of a school assignment to create a portfolio website. The portfolio showcases our skills and accomplishments, including a quiz application that allows users to take quizzes, view results, and track progress. The project is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end, with data stored either locally or in a backend database. The development process involved using GitHub for version control and collaboration, and Visual Studio Code (VSCode) as the code editor."</p>
