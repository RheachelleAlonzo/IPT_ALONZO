                <h3>2. System Development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</h3>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> I created a simple system (website or application) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project aimed to build an interactive and user-friendly platform for a specific function or task.</p>
                <p><strong>My Role:</strong> I was responsible for the entire front-end development of the system, focusing on designing a clean layout using HTML, styling it with CSS, and adding interactive elements with JavaScript.</p>
                <p><strong>Skills Learned:</strong> Front-end web development, JavaScript programming, problem-solving, and understanding the structure of web applications.</p>

            <p>These activities have greatly enhanced my technical and communication skills and have given me a deeper understanding of how technology can influence both academic and practical settings. I look forward to continuing to engage in such opportunities to learn and grow.</p>
